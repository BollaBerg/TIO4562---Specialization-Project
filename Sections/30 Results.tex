% \subsection{Descriptive Results} % See Lukkien et al.
\todo[inline]{Descriptive results - number of papers per stage, results from methodology. Include any relevant observations -- distribution of methodology (reviews vs primary (qualitative / quantitative) studies). Consider including an overview of each paper with its context and methodology (and possibly more?)}

% While the field is far from mature, 289 (?) unique results in the preliminary search means it is evolved enough for a systematic literature review

% Compare primary vs secondary studies

% Mention non-peer-reviewed papers included in the review, and why they were included

% Cite studies that might appear to meet the inclusion criteria, but which were excluded, and explain why they were excluded.


\subsection{Key concepts}
\import{Sections/}{35 Definitions}


\subsection{RQ1 -- Principles for responsible AI}
\label{sec:results-rq1}

% Discuss split of principles (core and non-core)

\subsubsection{Core principles}
% Discuss core principles
% Why are they core?
% Why these principles?
% Where, outside of responsible AI, has this divide been used?

\paragraph{Autonomy}

\paragraph{Beneficence}

\paragraph{Non-maleficence}

\paragraph{Justice}


\subsubsection{Instrumental principles}
% Discuss a little about the variation of principles
% Depends on time, domain and concrete project

\paragraph{Transparency}
% Why is transparency and explainability separated?

\paragraph{Explainability}

\paragraph{Accountability}

\paragraph{Privacy}

\paragraph{Trust}

\paragraph{Sustainability}

\paragraph{Data governance}

\paragraph{Laws and regulations}

\paragraph{Informed consent}

\paragraph{Predictability}

\paragraph{Quality benchmarking}

\paragraph{Interventions and co-design}

\paragraph{System performance}



% Then explanation of each principle, citing what the different sources have said, summarizing and possibly defining the principle in the context of RAI
% Include how the principles build upon each other / connections between principles
%   - I.e., how explainability is needed for the other principles to be applied
% Include also ways to enable the different principles, i.e. column "How to enable principles"

% Finally, discuss principles used by sources but not included here, as well as the reason why it was not included

% Possibly include some generic "How to enable principles" advice that apply to multiple principles
%   - E.g. data provenance (Werder K., Ramesh B., Zhang R.S.)

\subsection{RQ2 -- Antecedents for responsible AI}

\subsection{RQ3 -- Business advantages of responsible AI}
% Academic stuff

% Outside of academia... (see Snowballing sources)


\subsection{Alternative terms for responsible AI}
\label{sec:results-alernative-terms}
% A comparison of the different terms for responsible AI I have seen throughout the review, and how they compare to each other.
% Use as base for future research -- a complete taxonomy of the field, establishing common and standardized terms
% Possibly a comparison of SCOPUS hits for the given terms, to show their popularity in comparison to each other

% \subsection{Challenges with responsible AI}
\subsection{Criticisms of responsible AI}
\label{sec:results-criticism}
% What challenges / barriers have the review shown?
% I.e., lack of implementation guides / most guidelines are very general and vague (maybe a "how to implement RAI" subsection?)
%   - Are also found in general ethics: https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025411067&origin=resultslist&sort=cp-f&src=s&st1=autonomy+AND+beneficence+AND+justice&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=4734d518162d88ad8f175bc2a82e4e4f&sot=b&sdt=b&sl=41&s=ALL%28autonomy+AND+beneficence+AND+justice%29&relpos=9&citeCnt=324&searchTerm=
% "Ethics washing"
% Lack of quantitative research
