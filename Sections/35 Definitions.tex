% Definitions (both from review and thought-up myself)
Although theoretical and philosophical definitions fall slightly outside of the intended scope of this paper, it is necessary for a good understanding of responsible artificial intelligence to look at underlying terms and ensure clearly defined definitions related to the field. While many of the reviewed papers contain interesting and well-thought-out definitions, most of them wary significantly. There is thus a need to unify the definitions found in the field. To do so, this paper use the definitions found during the review, as well as some secondary material, to create classical definitions \parencite[p. 36]{Seppälä_2014} of the terms \textit{artificial intelligence}, \textit{artificial intelligence system} and \textit{responsible artificial intelligence}.

\subsubsection{Artificial intelligence}
\label{sec:definition-ai}
Not all the reviewed papers define the term, and the definitions that are mentioned differ in both wording and inclusion. For instance, \textcite[p. 258]{Mikalef_2022} builds on \textcite{Mikalef_2021_notreview} and define AI as \textquote{the ability of a system to identify, interpret, make inferences, and learn from data to achieve predetermined organisational and societal goals,} thus adopting a definition removed from technology but based on learning. The notion of learning is repeated by \textcite[p. 2]{Dignum_2021}, who defines AI as \textquote{A (computational) technology that is able to infer patterns and possibly draw conclusions from data.} Her definition differs from that of \citeauthor{Mikalef_2022} in that she focuses on the technology, rather than the system, and she does not include the notion of the system's goals.

Focusing strongly on the outcome and technological side of the technology, \textcite[p. 130-131]{Brand_2022} bases his definition on the Oxford dictionary definition of AI, defining it as \textquote{the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.} In a similar vein, \textcite[p. 1]{Havrda_2020} adopts the broad definition of AI given by \textcite{IEEE_vision} as \textquote{autonomous or intelligent software when installed into other software and/or hardware systems that are able to exercise independent reasoning, decision-making, intention forming, and motivating skills according to self-defined principles.}

Finally, several of the included papers focus on an ability of simulating humans. \textcite[p. 3-4]{Liu_2021} defines AI as \textquote{A broad range of techniques and approaches of computer science to simulate human intelligence in machines that are programmed for thinking like humans and mimic human behaviours, capable of performing tasks.} Similarly, \textcite[p. 3]{vanBruxvoort_2021} adopt the definition given by \textcite{Shubhendu_2013}, and define AI as \textquote{the study of ideas to bring into being machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention. Each such machine should engage in critical appraisal and selection of differing opinions within itself.}

As shown, there exists a wide range of definitions of AI. All of them lack certain characteristics, and thus this paper creates a new, at least compared to the reviewed papers, definition of AI. The notion of artificial intelligence is built on the idea of \textit{intelligence}, and that is thus a natural starting point for a new definition. \textcite{Legg_2007} presents a selection of definitions of intelligence, gathered from encyclopedias, psychologists and AI researchers. Combining these, they define intelligence as follows:
\begin{displayquote}[{\cite[p. 9]{Legg_2007}}][.]
    Intelligence measures an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments
\end{displayquote}
Following the structure given by \textcite{Seppälä_2014}, the definition of intelligence constitutes the majority of the differentia of the definition, so all that is left is to conclude the genus.

One way of finding the genus of the definition of artificial intelligence is through defining the term \textit{artificial}. An in-depth attempt at this is done by \parencite{Bianchini_2021}, who compares synthetic biology and artificial intelligence to create a common definition of what can be considered artificial. In the end, \citeauthor{Bianchini_2021} concludes that
\begin{displayquote}[{\cite[p. 13]{Bianchini_2021}}][.]
    The artificial is what is humanly constructed, often in a natural model, also through the manipulation of natural systems and processes, and maintains existing and acting/operating/behaving in an open-ended context or environment without human control, regardless the substance or materials of its constituent parts
\end{displayquote}
While the idea of the definition is interesting, some key errors appear when using this definition for artificial intelligence. First, there already exists cases of AI constructing other instances of AI \parencite{AI_making_AI}, thus invalidating the first part of the definition. Secondly, calls are made for using AI to work alongside humans instead of replacing them \parencite{AI_alongside}, a notion that is repeated by several of the reviewed papers (e.g., \cite{Vetro_2019,WangY_2020,Doorn_2021,Brand_2022,Havrda_2020}). As such, the second part of the definition falls apart, leaving little relevant information to be gathered from the proposed definition. The same can be seen when looking at ordinary dictionary entries. The most relevant definition of artificial by Merriam-Webster (\cite{dictionary_artificial}) defines it as \textquote{humanly contrived often on a natural model}. Here, too, the issue of AI constructing other instances of AI arises.

It is clear that typical definitions of artificial do not cover the artificiality of artificial intelligence. Instead of trying to define artificial then move to the combined term, another option is to consider similarities that exist between existing artificial intelligence technologies, then use those to create the complete definition. While this runs the risks of creating a prototypical definition \parencite[p. 36]{Seppälä_2014}, rather than the stated goal of a classical definition, this can be avoided by selecting sufficiently general similarities.

Common among the definitions given by the reviewed papers is the notion that artificial intelligence technology is based on computing and software, e.g., \textquote{...algorithm-driven computing technology...} \parencite[p. 1]{Siala_2022}, \textquote{...computer systems...} \parencite[p. 130]{Brand_2022}, \textquote{A (computational) technology...} \parencite[p. 2]{Dignum_2021}, \textquote{Autonomous or intelligent software...} \parencite[p. 1]{Havrda_2020}, \textquote{...techniques and approaches of computer science...} \parencite[p. 3]{Liu_2021}, and \textquote{Machine-based systems...} \parencite[p. 1]{Lukkien_2021}. This largely aligns with the original idea of artificial intelligence, which was based on \textquote{a shared vision that computers can be made to perform intelligent tasks} \parencite[p. 87]{Moor_2006}.

Combining this base of computers and software with the definition of intelligence, \textit{artificial intelligence} can be defined as follows:
\begin{displayquote}
    An artificial intelligence is a software- or semi-software based technology that is able to achieve defined goals in a wide range of environments.
\end{displayquote}

This definition of artificial intelligence covers several parts of the above-mentioned definitions. Achieving goals is closely related to the definition used by \textcite{Mikalef_2022}, and the definitions uses by \textcite{Brand_2022,Havrda_2020} are covered by selectively choosing goals. Likewise, this definition aligns with the definitions put forth by \textcite{Liu_2021,vanBruxvoort_2021}, but explicitly defines what constitutes \textquote{human intelligence}.

While encompassing much, this definition does not say anything about data, which is mentioned by \textcite{Mikalef_2022,Dignum_2021}. This means that also technologies that do not use data, but are able to operate in a wide range of environments, are considered as artificial intelligences. While the idea of artificial intelligence operating without large amounts of data may be considered strange in times of big data \parencite{Singh_2022} and deep learning \parencite{Lecun_2015}, this ensures potential future intelligent technologies are included in the definition, no matter the amount of data they use.

The rest of this paper will be based on this definition.

\subsubsection{Responsible artificial intelligence}
\label{sec:definition-responsibleAI}
% As the benefits of AI are widely discussed, we will consider AI systems to be the default (i.e., what is compared against), so any discussed business advantages are of the responsible part, not the AI part
Following the previous two subsections, the only thing that remains in order to understand principles, antecedents and advantages of responsible AI is a proper definition of the term. The definitions of responsible AI used by the reviewed papers vary slightly. For instance, \textcite[p. 6]{Doorn_2021} defines responsible AI simply as AI that is \textquote{consistent with important ethical values,} whereas \textcite[p. 4964]{WangY_2020} defines it as human-centered governance framework, used to \textquote{harness, deploy, evaluate, and monitor AI machines to create new opportunities for better service provision.} In a similar vein, \textcite[p. 58-59]{Papagiannidis_2022} get their definition from \textcite{Singapore_framework}, who defines responsible AI as \textquote{the process of designing, developing, and deploying artificial intelligence with the purpose of enabling individuals and organizations while also having a fair effect on customers and society.} % Add Dignum 2019

Several of the reviewed papers use a set of principles as the core of their definition (e.g., \cite{WangW_2021,Cheng_2021}). \textcite[p. 83]{BarredoArrieta_2020} define responsible AI as \textquote{a series of AI principles to be necessarily met when deploying AI in real applications.} In a similar fashion, \textcite[p. 258]{Mikalef_2022} builds on \textcite{Accenture_AIservices}, and define responsible AI as \textquote{a set of principles that ensure ethical, transparent, and accountable use of AI technologies.} Such principles typically make up the core of tools used to achieve responsible AI, and will be further studies later in \autoref{sec:results-rq1}. However, other tools for achieving the goals of responsible AI exist \parencite{Werder_2022}, and calls have been made for moving away from principles in the pursuit of responsibility \parencite{Henriksen_2021}.

Instead, inspiration for a definition can, once again, be found in dictionaries. Cambridge Dictionary \parencite{dictionary_responsible} has, amongst others, the following two definitions for the word \textit{responsible}: (1) \textquote{to be in control of yourself so that you can fairly be blamed for your bad actions,} and (2) \textquote{having good judgment and the ability to act correctly and make decisions on your own.} Using these definitions as foundation, it is clear that a responsible AI system must have some form of accountability, in order to be fairly blamed for its actions, while also acting in a "correct" way. This leaves the act of concluding what constitutes "correct" acting. In the reviewed papers, this is largely done by a set of principles, which will be further discussed in \autoref{sec:results-rq1}. The notion of what is a "correct" act, however, can vary between different technical systems \parencite{Hagendorff_2020}, as well as different cultures and background \parencite{Ford_1994}. Although some attempts have been made (e.g. \cite{Jobin_2019,Hagendorff_2020}), no universally agreed-upon set of principles exist.

In order to create a globally acceptable definition of responsible AI, this paper instead bases its definition of responsible AI on a utilitarian view of ethics, which simplifies a "correct" act to one that leads to maximum global utility \parencite{Lang_2004}, i.e., the largest possible amount of "good" for the largest possible amount of people. This paper also adopts the notion of \parencite{Trocin_2021}, who suggest that a key aspect of responsible AI is its ability to reduce ethical issues. Combining these two aspects leads to defining responsible artificial intelligence as
\begin{displayquote}
    An AI system designed, developed and used in an ethical and accountable way, to ensure maximum global utility and to mitigate or eliminate ethical issues of AI.
\end{displayquote}

Two results of this definition is in contrast to existing literature: (1) responsible AI being something that must actively be targeted to be achieved, and (2) responsible AI being a state of an AI system. Result (1) is in contrast with the view of \textcite{Merhi_2022}, who argues that responsible AI is something that happens once a set of barriers are removed. While responsible AI can be created without actively using the term "responsible AI," this definition requires that the system is created with ethical goals in mind, and as such is not something that can happen without conscious acting. Result (2) appears appears to be in contrast with \textcite{Ahmad_2021}, who argue that AI systems in practice are more like processes than end products. Their claims, however, are part of the current definition of AI systems, thus aligning the two papers.

% Look at advantages of AI that is responsible, or advantages of responsible AI compared to non-responsible AI. This paper uses the latter.
